Multiplayer hasn't been implemented yet.

Local Game is where you want to go. From there, the user can choose to either host a game, or join one either as a player or a spectator by clicking on the list view item with the host's device name and address.
Afterwards, the user is moved to waiting screen which is a chat room. The host chooses when to start the game by clicking the Start the Game button. Everyone is moved to play screen.
The host and the players take turns, typing 3 words. Spectators can watch but not play. At any point, the user can click back to go to the chat room, re-enter the game or even go all the way back.
Devices with larger screens can use the "chat" and the "story" rooms at the same time.

At any point, the user can choose to save the story.
If the player moves to starting screen and selects Local Game, a dialog pops up asking him if he wants to continue or start a new game.
It's essential for the bluetooth to stay on at all times, otherwise the user will be disconnected. The game ends when the user or the host disconnect.

Hall of Stories list all the stories that the user has saved. The player can click on and read it again!
About contains a few info behind the application, as well as instructions and a contact button.
